# IoT-Based Health Monitoring System 🩺🌐

An Internet of Things (IoT) based health monitoring system designed to measure and visualize real-time vital signs like SpO2, heart rate (ECG), temperature, and humidity. Built as part of our final year B.Tech project in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Haldia Institute of Technology.

## 🔧 Features

- Real-time monitoring of:
  - 🌬️ **SpO2** and **Heart Rate** using MAX30102
  - ❤️ **ECG Signals** using AD8232
  - 🌡️ **Temperature** and **Humidity** using DHT11
- Wireless data transmission via **ESP32 Wi-Fi**
- Remote visualization through **Blynk Mobile App**
- Low-cost and portable design ideal for rural and home-based patient care

## 🛠️ Components Used

- **ESP32 Dev Board**
- **MAX30102** – Pulse oximeter and heart rate sensor
- **AD8232** – ECG sensor
- **DHT11** – Temperature and humidity sensor
- **Blynk App** – For mobile dashboard

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Sensors collect health data from the user
2. ESP32 processes and sends data via Wi-Fi
3. Blynk app receives and displays live readings
4. Users can view health parameters remotely
